## QPN

TSV (April 12, 2024):
- num. healthy controls: 67
- num. PD patients: 205
- (rest are PPS, etc.)

Query tool / API:
- num HC: 294/303
- num PD patients: 276/303


## Q's about current query template
- Should having a phenotypic session not be optional?
- Subject group (HC) is currently modeled at the session level but maybe should be instead a subject-level property, or at least standardized across sessions for a subject
    - can subject group change across timepoints (?)
