## Error boundary

Used to catch rendering errors and display a fallback UI. See relevant React documentation page [here](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) for more information.

According to [this stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48482619/how-can-i-make-use-of-error-boundaries-in-functional-react-components), there are no native functional implementation for the error boundary component in react. See also the following pages of the legacy react docs:
- [Do hooks cover all cases for classes?](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#do-hooks-cover-all-use-cases-for-classes)
